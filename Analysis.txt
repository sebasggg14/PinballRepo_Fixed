So there’s this game on Roblox called Royale High.  Truthfully speaking, its a really bad game in almost every sense of the word. First of all, its a Roblox game, so the bar is already in hell. Its just that I have a special attachment with that game and recently fell back into its grasps. One thing I do like about the game is its main art style (hotbar ui, in-game popups, character sprites, etc.), and so with this project I wanted to sort of mimic that. In the game there’s these 6 elements (dark, light, water, fire, earth, ice), and so I wanted to sort of incorporate that in the theme. I figured 6 elements would be too much, so I just stuck with 3, fire, water, and earth. 
I think the thing that took the most time was actually all the spritework, especially the UI. I wanted to make it as close to the in-game UI as possible, so I spent a lot of time making sure it looked like it would be in the same universe. I do think, however, that because I put a lot of effort into the spritework, I wasn't able to put as much effort into unique code. I wanted to add a camera-shake effect when the ball hit anything, but I wasn’t able to figure it out and didn’t have time to experiment further. I am, however, proud of the fade-into-black transition, since even though it isn’t a whole lot of code, I feel that it really adds to the game feel.
